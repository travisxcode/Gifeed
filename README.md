# Gifeed with The Composable Architecture (TCA)

This project provides an introduction to the practices of the Composable Architecture, from simple business logic to more sophisticated flows. TCA allows us to set up the project in a way that is systematically designed for modularization and reusability.

# Motivation

When starting a new project, it's important to consider which design patterns are best suited to the project's complexity. This project demonstrates practical, real-world problems and solutions using TCA. The aim is to showcase TCA as the future of Swift development, even extending beyond just iOS applications.

> Go TCA or go home

This demo serves as an example TCA project, providing basic examples and more intricate logic. It offers clear documentation and practical insights for using TCA in a realistic application context.
